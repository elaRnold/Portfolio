        After earning my bachelor's degree in <span className="font-medium">computer science</span>, 
        I decided to expand my passion for programming by working as a freelancer while learning various
        frameworks and technologies. I enrolled in various programming courses
        at Udemy and the Colombian ICT Ministry, where I learned complete{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">web/mobile development</span>. One of my greatest achievements was working for
        the University of the North (Barranquilla) on an R&D project about Covid
        19 in older adults, there I was able to develop a toolkit to support
        health professionals to determine if a patient had chances of
        contracting this condition.

        <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        My favorite part of programming is the
        problem solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the feeling of finally finding a solution
        to a problem. My main stack is <span className="font-medium">Next.js, Nest.js, Laravel, and Node</span>. I&apos;m
        also familiar with TypeScript and Microsoft Azure. I am always looking
        to learn new technologies.
